fix anubis - adjust command parsing system
--------------------
[x] expiry dates
-------------------
[x] .reset-popularity
-------------------
[x] popularity percentages - put only to 2 characters (rounding) for example 54%, 82%, 69%
-------------------
[x] blacklist, REMOVE USER INPUT 
-------------------
[x] copy ip lookup func
-------------------
[x] make a plan function (allows admins to create plans with custom
concs and time, as well as cool down)
-------------------
[x] im not sure if you have done this, but a quick way of parsing
the preset attack commands to my spoof servers using ssh? maybe a file
which requires the ssh port and pass, as well as the server IP obvs
-------------------
[x] individual user lock down or even a message broadcast?
except not on the title writer, on the actual c2. so basically
they cant use the c2 while the msg is displayed

[x] so then i could do the command : ".pm niggermissional 'STOP FUCKING SPAMMING' 120"
the arguments : .pm <myra-user> <display msg> <lockdown duration for user>
-------------------
maybe an email warning if some user who has unlimited is spamming 5+ concurrents.
-------------------
[x] myra c2 anti spam?? just like discord, where it mutes you? not necessary
but would be pretty cool, i could turn it on via command if the net is busy
and then also turn it off if necessary 
-------------------
[x] ADD THIS TO LOCKDOWN : basically any new connections to myra while lockdown
is initiated, myra will display the msg "Myra lockdown is currently initiated."
-------------------
.status - command which displays the cpu usage percentage of the c2,
that would be pretty cool
-------------------
[x] user usage popularity?? maybe see who is sending attacks the most as well as who
has connected to the net the most, maybe put the values of how many times they 
have connected to myra as well as how many attacks they have sent 

--------------------
maybe a reflector map for each reflection based method.
you click on the method where you wanna see all their reflectors mapped.

-------------------
[x] Myra attack blacklist using a command like `.blacklist-attack <ip>` 

-------------------
[x] .change-pass <password> : users can change their own pass if needed

[x] admins can reset other passes using :
.reset-pass <username / uid> <password>
-------------------
