DDOS-WORLD is an educational project designed to explore Distributed Denial of Service (DDoS) attacks and potential countermeasures. This project provides tools, scripts, and examples to understand the mechanisms behind DDoS attacks while studying solutions to defend against them effectively. This project is for educational purposes only and aims to improve network security in a controlled environment.

Overview üß†
DDoS attacks pose a significant threat to the stability of network infrastructures. DDOS-WORLD aims to provide users with a deep understanding of the techniques used in these attacks and appropriate defense mechanisms. The project includes practical examples, protection scripts, and tools to monitor and prevent DDoS attacks. This project is intended to be used solely in learning environments and ethical testing scenarios.

Project Structure üóÇÔ∏è
1. ANTI-DDOS
Contains solutions and scripts to protect against DDoS attacks. You will find tools to harden network infrastructures and mitigate the impact of these attacks.

2. API
Examples of APIs to interact with network management systems and automate responses to ongoing attacks.

3. BLOCKED_SSH_CONNECTION
Scripts to detect and block malicious SSH connections, along with best practices for securing remote SSH access.

4. BOT
Examples of bot scripts used in DDoS attacks, to understand their functionality and design defense systems accordingly.

5. BOTNET
Includes scripts and information about botnets, often used to coordinate large-scale DDoS attacks.

6. C2
Explores Command and Control (C2) infrastructures used to orchestrate distributed attacks, with examples to understand how they are organized.

7. CNC
Contains scripts and examples for configuring and using Command and Control (CNC) servers.

8. Dstat
Monitoring tools to observe network and system performance, allowing real-time visualization of the impact of DDoS attacks.

9. FUNNEL
Explores funnel techniques, where traffic is redirected or concentrated toward a specific target, often used in DDoS attacks.

10. L7FIVEM-PATCH
Patches to protect FiveM servers from Layer 7 (Application Layer) DDoS attacks.

11. METHODS
Lists different DDoS attack methods (SYN Flood, UDP Flood, Amplification, etc.) with concrete examples to better understand their execution.

12. OTHER STUFF
Various additional scripts and files that are not directly related to a specific category but enrich the overall understanding of the project.

13. PAPING
Uses Paping, a tool to test network latency and connectivity via TCP, often employed to diagnose DDoS attacks.

14. PROXY
Configurations and scripts for using proxies, either for protection against attacks or to mask traffic sources in attack scenarios.

15. RESOLVER
Tools for resolving domain names or IP addresses, used in both attack and defense scenarios.

16. SCAN
Scripts to scan networks for vulnerabilities that could be exploited in DDoS attacks.

17. SITEWEB
Web interfaces to monitor DDoS attacks in real time and manage defense systems.

Educational Objective üéì
This project is designed to:

Understand DDoS Attacks: Learn how these attacks work and what the primary techniques are.
Explore Defense Solutions: Test and understand methods to mitigate or block attacks.
Simulate Real-World Environments: Experiment with tools and scripts in secure and controlled environments.
Enhance Network Security: Develop strong skills in network infrastructure management and cybersecurity.
Installation ‚öôÔ∏è
Clone the repository:

git clone https://github.com/royaloakap/DDOS-WORLD.git
cd DDOS-WORLD
Install any required dependencies:

pip install -r requirements.txt
Run the various scripts in a secure environment for testing.

Usage üöÄ
Each directory contains individual scripts and README files that guide you through the usage of each tool. The goal is to experiment and understand how DDoS attacks are orchestrated and how to defend against them.

Disclaimer ‚ö†Ô∏è
This project is strictly for educational purposes. Any use of these tools outside of a legal and authorized framework is prohibited. DDoS attacks are illegal in many countries and can result in severe criminal penalties. Never use these scripts on infrastructures without obtaining the necessary permissions.
